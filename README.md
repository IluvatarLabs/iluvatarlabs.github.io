# Iluvatar Labs

Bio-inspired AI architectures for the AGI era.

We study nature's intelligence to engineer tomorrow's artificial minds.

## About

Iluvatar Labs is developing next-generation AI architectures by learning from nature's blueprint—drawing insights from biological intelligence and evolutionary processes to bridge the gap between current AI and artificial general intelligence.

We chase moonshots others won't attempt, pursuing radically creative approaches and bold experimentation to unlock breakthrough discoveries.

Our mission: to build AI that works for everyone, drawing from billions of years of biological intelligence and innovation.
